Machine Learning
#### Credit card frauds are easy and friendly targets. E-commerce and many other online sites have increased the online payment modes, increasing the risk for online frauds. Increase in fraud rates, researchers started using different machine learning methods to detect and analyse frauds in online transactions. The main aim of this project is to design and develop a novel fraud detection method using Seaborn, MatplotLib, Pandas, Numpy.

#### “Fraud detection is a set of activities that are taken to prevent money or property from being obtained through false pretenses.”
### How Does Credit Card Fraud Happen?
##### Credit card fraud is usually caused either by card owner’s negligence with his data or by a breach in a website’s security. Here are some examples:

###### A consumer reveals his credit card number to unfamiliar individuals. 
###### A card is lost or stolen and someone else uses it.
###### Mail is stolen from the intended recipient and used by criminals.
###### Business employees copy cards or card numbers of its owner.
###### Making a counterfeit credit card.

#### When your card is lost or stolen, an unauthorized charge can happen; in other words, the person who finds it uses it for a purchase. Criminals can also forge your name and use the card or order some goods through a mobile phone or computer. Also, there is the problem of using a counterfeit credit card – a fake card that has the real account information that was stolen from holders. That is especially dangerous because the victims have their real cards, but do not know that someone has copied their card. Such fraudulent cards look quite legitimate and have the logos and encoded magnetic strips of the original one. Fraudulent credit cards are usually destroyed by the criminals after several successful payments, just before a victim realizes the problem and reports it.
