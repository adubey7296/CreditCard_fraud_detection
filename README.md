Machine Learning
#### Credit card frauds are easy and friendly targets. E-commerce and many other online sites have increased the online payment modes, increasing the risk for online frauds. Increase in fraud rates, researchers started using different machine learning methods to detect and analyse frauds in online transactions. The main aim of this project is to design and develop a novel fraud detection method using Seaborn, MatplotLib, Pandas, Numpy.

#### “Fraud detection is a set of activities that are taken to prevent money or property from being obtained through false pretenses.”
### How Does Credit Card Fraud Happen?
